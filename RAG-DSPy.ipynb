      "\n",
      "1] Restaurant: Impossible | Restaurant: Impossible is an American reality television series, featuring chef and restaurateur Robert Irvine, that aired on Food Network from 2011 to 2016. \n",
      "\n",
      "2] Jean Joho | Jean Joho is a French-American chef and restaurateur. He is chef/proprietor of Everest in Chicago (founded in 1986), Paris Club Bistro & Bar and Studio Paris in Chicago, The Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Las Vegas, and Brasserie JO in Boston. \n",
      "\n",
      "3] List of Restaurant: Impossible episodes | This is the list of the episodes for the American cooking and reality television series \"Restaurant Impossible\", produced by Food Network. The premise of the series is that within two days and on a budget of $10,000, celebrity chef Robert Irvine renovates a failing American restaurant with the goal of helping to restore it to profitability and prominence. Irvine is assisted by a designer (usually Taniya Nayak, Cheryl Torrenueva, or Lynn Keagan, but sometimes Vanessa De Leon, Krista Watterworth, Yvette Irene, or Nicole Faccuito), along with general contractor Tom Bury, who sometimes does double duty as both general contractor and designer. After assessing the problems with the restaurant, Robert Irvine typically creates a plan for the new decor, oversees the cleaning of the restaurant, reduces the size of the menu and improves the food, develops a promotional activity, educates the restaurant's owners, or trains the staff, as needed by each restaurant. \n",
